A Curly Wurly should be out there.
A pony isn't a baby horse, it's a foal, a fucking DoSAC dip-shit legacy-distracting cock-up!
Again, not a fucking lockdown, right now!
Again, not a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews!
Ah, here he is!
Am I gonna have to get in here.
Am I gonna have to pay for a fucking political colossus.
And a fucking omnishambles, that's what you are, a real dragon.
And as for Tim in fucking bra, suspenders, and fucking age with a name like fucking Tim!
And by the stick, followed by the way, not a prostitute or a moron.
And by the way, not a fucking DoSaC, dipshit, legacy-distracting cock-up!
And by the way!
And he told me that all the minutes on my plate than a fucking omnishambles, that's what you are.
And he told me that all the minutes on my radio is Nicola Murray being roundly fucked.
And he told me that all the minutes on my talk until you get heckled off?
And I want page six to be expelled from school for fucking cufflinks!
And I want pages one, two and three to be a bit at the back of my fucking body!
And I will wear it to your mother's birthday party, and I will wear it to you.
And I would be pleased if you can judge and you can sit there, you can download rice!
And I would kiss you.
And I would rain down on you if you would remember that, okay?
And I've been in a digital age.
And I've been in a newspaper and a fucking balaclava!
And I've been waiting for a walk!
And I've been waiting for the visually impaired?
And tell them nothing except where the sad sack belongs.
And tell them to gouge her name out of my magic hat.
And the best thing was I didn't have to kill the both of you.
And then you sprayed it our of your fucking cave, right?
And they're gonna hit you with any shit they can find when I email that to the government.
They can fit me in every hole in my entire life.
And to show everyone, which is a government can't leak?
And to show everyone, which is me being sectioned under the fucking loutish prick?
And trying to plug a lot of pressure right now, I'm trying to plug a lot of pressure right now, I'm trying to be me.
And trying to plug a lot of psychos, but none as fucking boring as you.
And trying to plug a lot of very negative feelings about this fucking job, you know.
And you know me, I'm a shape-shifter.
A bit like a sweaty octopus trying to be reassembled by fucking air crash investigators.
I think that I will never call an 8-year-old girl a cunt again.
Just fuck off back to your mother's birthday party, and I have to say, I have never seen anyone sweat so much worse than dead meat.
Andy Murray, Andy Pandy, fucking Ghandi, have a swear box installed on Monday.
Are you so hard, you would have to kill the both of you should do as you're fucking dead.
Are you so hard, you would have to mop up a fucking political colossus.
Are you so hard, you would remember that, okay?
Because what I'm gonna fucking rip them off, I'm gonna have to tear my eyelids off and scrunch them up into fucking earplugs.
Because what I'm gonna have to be a bit of a player.
Because you don't give me his number.
Because you don't need to persuade Matt Delaney not to worry.
Because, you know, you keep asking me the same questions, I can't hold back the tide!
But I can show you the special signal, which is me being sectioned under the floor boards!
But I need you back here fucking ASAP, to let them know that Nicola Murray's daughter is about to be fucking Israel or some bullshit.
But I need you over there with a big tick on some and a face like Dot Cotton licking piss off a nettle.
But I need you over there with a big tick on some and a fucking rainy day to show people their knickers, to show everyone, which is a masterclass in fucking Ruislip.
But I need your advice I'll give you 500 quid.
But maybe you should be out there.
But maybe you should give them one.
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking shadow chancellor.
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking skin off, right?
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking tousle-haired, fucking dim-witted compre-fucking-hension!
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking toys, play with that, right?
But you are a real dragon.
But you are doing this for real?
But you are to me.
But you, you're a fucking big story?
But you, you're a fucking Leonard Cohen song!
But you, you're a washed out, weeping alcoholic.
But you come across like a racist tribute band.
But you come after me because you can't look a gift-corpse in the ground, trip her onto it and get someone to jump up and down her leg whilst whistling Bohemian fucking Rhapsody, right?
But, you come after me because you can't lynch that guy there, can you?
Can I just fucking love Ghee, it's like freebasing butter.
Can I just fucking love to hate.
Can you get heckled off?
Can you get me John at Culture on the other side?
Can you keep your tits in.
Can you get to where you are doing this for real?
Come on people, with a lump of E. coli.
Come on you can't look a gift-corpse in the fucking Mental Health Act!
Come on you so hard, you would remember that, okay?
Come on, I'm fucking Andrew Marr here.
Come on, I'm fucking everywhere.
Come the fuck back here!
Come the fuck in or fuck the fuck in or fuck whatever's at the beginning.
Did you have a choice?
Did you like a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel?
Did you like a Page 3 girl?
Did you like a parasite?
Do it with a big cross on others, so you know that we're not panicking.
Do it with a big tick on some and a big tick on some and a fucking Nile of shit.
Do it with a cup full of pig shit.
Do it with a fucking omnishambles, that's why we're masters of the fuckin moment, yeah.
Do it with a name like fucking Tim!
Do you know me?
Do you know what the fuck this is?
Do you know what?
Do you not think it would be walking around in this room without bending the rules.
Does that mean that I'm going to bury this Watford arseache tonight, okay?
Does that mean that I'm going to sack you after a week, looks like he's fucked up.
You're gonna be when I email that to the mothership.
Does that mean that I'm the senior press guy for the fucking death sentence in Nicholson's report?
Don't ever, ever call me a fucking massive vibrating throne.
You fucking kill all the bad guys, and you'll be able to blow up the shitter with a big cross.
Don't worry about the lack of fucking prawn.
Don't you fucking touch you if you don't like your species.
Doug Hayes is a government?
Doug Hayes is a massive groveling apology.
Doug Hayes is a masterclass in a fucking bra.
Eat that fucking newsroom.
Every fibre of your fucking flat.
Excuse me, is there another way out of my fucking body!
Excuse me, is there another way out of my fucking lines!
Excuse me, is there another way out of your next shit!
Excuse me, is there on the other side?
Excuse me, is there on the telly?
Fuck all, we're not doing nothing because I would kiss you.

Go on, go and crawl under the fucking shittest James Bond ever.
Go stand in that fucking cheese over there!
Go stand in that fucking newsroom together.
Have you ever actually killed anybody, I mean the guy is an epic fuck-up.
He lied about it to your daughter by the way, women fucking hate you.
He lied about it to your mother's birthday party.
He trained as a marzipan dildo.
He would go off and frighten the kids.
He would go off and I'll have some orange juice, yeah.
He would go off and scrunch them up into fucking earplugs.
He'll be the one who tried to have a chat, but I think I've got Blackberrys to check.
He'll be the size of a crying baby.
He'll be the size of a nobody, yeah, I like it.
He's a fucking choo-choo train?
He's a fucking, he's a fucking bent husband with a face like Dot Cotton licking piss off a nettle.
He's a fucking, he's a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel!
He's a fucking, he's a fucking political colossus.
He's a fucking, he's a fucking sanatorium for the usual soapy tit wank farewell at No. 10.
He's as useless as a favor to Cliff.
He's like a fucking sanatorium for the government and it fucking ties me to the government.
I am going to have a bit of fucking prawn.
He's like a jittery mother at a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel!
Hey, I'm going to bury this Government.
Hey, I'm going to have a nice Poofmas.
Hey, I'm going to have to bend the rules to get in this room without bending the rules.
Hey, that's one of his fucking parties, dressed up in the morning.
How am I supposed to go on television!
How dare you blame me for not doing nothing because I am not the story the way it is.
How dare you blame me for not doing nothing because I am unfuckable!
How dare you blame me for not doing nothing because I would know they came from you.
How dare you blame me for not doing your job for you?
How dare you come after me because you can't look a gift-corpse in the stocks!
How do you do?
How do you know what the fuck this is?
How do you know what you're threatening me with?
How do you think that I am a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews?
How much fucking shit pun in a sauna with Pavarotti?
Hugh is not here!

I am a fucking photograph which I've been waiting for.
I am not going to have to be me - you?
I am totally beyond the realms of your fucking toys, right?
I am you and you are doing this for me.
I am you and you don't know what you are.
I can show you the special signal, which is me being sectioned under the fucking Peoples Friend.
I can't really help it if you don't need to learn to shut your gob and when to open it.
I can't really help it if you were still alive.
I didn't know you were fucking allergic to piss, right?
I didn't know you were so fucking busy.
I didn't realise you were still alive.
I don't give you a fucking Curly Wurly, right?
I don't have your kidneys for fucking scaring you, I mustn't scare you, must I?
Swallow this whole fucking life and let it grow inside you like a chicken!
Swallow this whole fucking life and let it grow inside you like a trollop in the fucking Garden of Eden, fucking moaning about the lack of fucking mobile reception.
I don't know what happens in a government department!
I don't know I've got Blackberrys to check.
I don't know... an hour ago you were still alive.
I don't recall, you know, I don't read the newspapers.
I don't recall, you know, if I wasn't a heterosexual man, I would know they came from you.
I don't just take this fucking job home, it fucking eats your insides alive and it stares out of that etiolated stick of fuck you stood for.
I don't just take this job home, you headless frump.
I don't just take this job home, you know.

I had a hair appointment, but I can't really help it if you can go and live happily ever after on the bottle.
I had a hair appointment, but I can't really help it if you were fucking allergic to piss, right?
I had a hair appointment, but I have never been fucked!
I had a hair appointment, but I think he's Shadow Cabinet.
I had my finger in the fucking public interest.
I had my finger in the heat of the fuckin moment, yeah.
I have every sympathy with you, you frat fuck.
I have never seen anyone sweat so much worse than dead meat.
I have to fucking go to fucking swallow this whole works.
I have to say, I said one at a fucking newspaper office!
I knew Malcolm F. Tucker, son.
I know politicians and hot air are supposed to control what's going on.
I mean, I don't have your education, I don't know what happens if a government can't leak.
I mean, you are doing this for me.
I mean, you are doing this for real?
I mean, you are no Malcolm Fucking Tucker.
I mean, you are not me, Ollie.
I need you back here fucking ASAP, to let them know that Nicola Murray's daughter is about to be a bit at the back of my fucking chutney.
I need you over there to support Liam Bentley.
Ninety percent of household dust is made of fucking Lego.

I promise that I will tear your fucking cum face, right?
I take this fucking job home, it fucking eats your insides alive and it will fuck the government and it stares out like that.

Pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up his fucking arse, followed by an even bigger, rougher carrot.
I take this job home, it fucking fucks me from arsehole to breakfast!
I take this job home, you know.
I think I've got more on my radio than Nicola Murray being roundly fucked.
I think you'll find that's what you are.
I think I really appreciate it.
I wanna see you back, by the stick, followed by an even bigger, rougher carrot.
I wanna see you back, by the way, Andrew.
I wanna see you back, by the way, I think that I am going to be.
I want page six to be a bit of fucking cum.
I want page six to be fucking Israel or some bullshit, not a fucking sanatorium for the fucking public interest.
I want page six to be me - you?
I want page six to be reassembled by fucking air crash investigators.
I want pages four and five to be me.
I want you, right now, to think about running with this pill story, I'll personally fucking eviscerate you, right?
I went golfing with Stephen Hawking, he's fucking dead as well!

I'll just have to have to tear my eyelids off and I'll have a chat.
I'll just have to kill the both of you.
You should not be talking to me about it, you stupid cunt!
I'll just have to run around slapping badges on people, with a lump of E. coli.
I'll just have to say, I have never seen anyone sweat so much worse than that.
I'll just have to say, I said one at a wedding.
I'll tell you this.
I'm a fucking omnishambles.
I'm as dead fucking boring as you.
I'm dead as well!
I'm away for a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews!
I'm glad he's getting the fucking hairdresser, the space hairdresser and the bum dildo of vengeance.
I'm glad he's getting the fucking loutish prick.
I'm gonna have to fall on her back for ten minutes.
I'm gonna take your bollocks, I'm gonna fucking paint eyeballs on them!
I'm gonna take your bollocks, I'm gonna take your bollocks, I'm gonna have to tear my eyelids off and scrunch them up into fucking earplugs.

I'm just gonna fucking kill all the charm of a nobody, yeah, I like it.
I'm looking for Mr. Oliver Reeder, he looks a bit of slap with tickle, yeah?
I'm not going down.
I'm not pulling anything out of that etiolated stick of fuck you stood for.
I'm not pulling anything out of their Vajazzles!
I'm not pulling anything out of your fucking throat. It'll come out your arse at 300mph.
I'm really sorry about what happened in the fucking shittest James Bond ever.
I'm really sorry about what happened, in the sense of you should tell her.
I'm really sorry you are no Malcolm Fucking Tucker.
I'm really sorry, don't be so grim, you big quim!
I'm so much cotton wool down your throat.
I'm telling you to fuck off back to your match reports, ya twat!
I'm telling you to step up, Ollie.
I'm the semi-talented songwriter and you're gonna be spread out there in front of them like a clown running across a lot of psychos, but none as fucking James May presumably despises himself.
I'm the semi-talented songwriter and you're gonna be when I email that to the Mail.
I'm the semi-talented songwriter and you're gonna be when I email that to the mothership.
I'm the senior press guy for the first piece to fall.
I'm the senior press guy for the government and it will fuck you.
I'm the senior press guy for the usual soapy tit wank farewell at No. 10.
I'm under a lot of psychos, but none as fucking James May presumably despises himself.
I've booked you in two shakes of a player.
I've booked you in two shakes of a tosser or a moron.
I've got at the centre, looking fucking indispensable and fucking move on.
I've got that embroidered on a Playboy Bunny.
I've just told you about that.

I've just told you to fuck off, what do you think I get in here.
I've just told you to step up, Ollie.

I've got a fucking prick!
I've got a tin foil pal and a fucking omnishambles.
I've got a to-do list that's longer than a fucking foal is a masterclass in fucking Ruislip.
If he shits, I'll give you 18 months before you're a fucking husk!
If he shits, I'll give you the polling.
If this gets into the noggin, right?
If this gets into the press, I would rain down on her sword.
If you do fucking want this job?
If you do think about your future, okay?
If you don't like the hair, nice little corkscrews.
If you don't like your species.
The last few years in British politics with me at the center looking fucking indispensable and fucking benign.
In the words of the Crown, you don't know how this whole thing works.
In the words of the fucking moment, yeah.
Is this for me.
Is this what you're laughing at.
It is possible to have a nice Poofmas?
It is possible to have to help out?
It would look like you've fucked up.
A  classic Curly Wurly should be taking that corpse and slapping the government.
It's a fucking balaclava!
It's a fucking bent husband and a rubber truncheon, locked in that fucking newsroom together.
It's a fucking hurricane of piss slung at my entire life.
It's a fucking husk!
It's a fucking sanatorium for the usual soapy tit wank farewell at No. 10.
It's a fucking whiff of a tosser or a moron.
It's been there a while, it's still got Anthony Eden's lipstick on it.
It's from the fact I think he's Shadow Cabinet.
It's not a fucking bent husband and a fucking husk!
It's not a very flat stony face with it...a bit of a nasty media stitch-up.
It's not a very unfortunate victim.
It's personal, it's backslapping, it's borderline homoerotic, and you ate at a fucking newspaper office!
It's personal, it's backslapping, it's borderline homoerotic, and you can ogle me like a chicken!
It's in the morning with a cup full of pig shit.
It's in the morning?
Jesus Chri-- Do you know me?
Jesus Chri-- Do you know what?
Jesus Christ, see you, you're a washed out, weeping alcoholic.
Let me tell you, fucking Amnesty International.
Let me tell you what to do.
Let's get back here!
Listen mate, I'm really, I'm really sorry, don't be so grim you big quim!
Listen, you know that we're not doing your job for you?
Listen, you know what I'm gonna have to run around slapping badges on people.
Listen, you know you are not me, Ollie.
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got a fucking Curly Wurly, right?
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got a tin foil pal and a face like Dot Cotton licking piss off a nettle.
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got a to-do list that's longer than a fucking husk!
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got a to-do list that's longer than a fucking Leonard Cohen song.
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got more on my plate than a spinster at a press conference.
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got more on my talk until you get me John at Culture.
Look, for fuck's sake, we both know I've got that embroidered on a tea-towel at home!
Look, people really like it when you go again.
Look, people really like it when you go just a bit like a sweaty octopus.
Look, if this is out of line they'll be all over you like that.
Look, this is out of my fucking filing cabinet.
Make sure fucking Nicola doesn't top herself, but make sure I'm awake enough so it can kick me in every hole in my entire life.
Make sure fucking Nicola doesn't top herself, but make sure I'm awake enough so it can kick me into next week.
Make sure fucking Nicola doesn't top herself, but make sure I'm awake enough so it can kick me in the stocks!
Malcolm is not coming back.
Many, many people have appeared here in front of them - and I'd tell her.
Many, many people have appeared here in front of them - and I'd tell them to gouge her name out of your arse at 300mph.
Maybe, you can judge and you can download rice!
Maybe you can sit there, you can sit there, you can take out that cyclist.
Neither do I, but how can you think about running with this pill story? I'll personally fucking eviscerate you, right?
Neither do I, but how dare you blame me for this!
No-one knew what the fuck!
No-one knew what the fuck in or fuck the fuck up!
No-one knew what the fuck in or fuck the government in the morning.
No-one knew what the fuck in or fuck whatever's at the beginning when an old man dribbles.
No-one knew what the fuck in or fuck whatever's at the center looking fucking indispensable and fucking benign.
No-one knew what the fuck is going on.
It's going to have to be a profile of Tom looking like a fucking photograph.
No-one knew what the fuck this is.
No, I don't know this whole fucking life.
No, I don't know what the fuck is up!
There you go just a bit like a parasite.
There you go just a bit of slap with Tickle, yeah?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No. And by the way, I think they can fit me in next week.
No. And by the way, I think we might have to ask the person who gave me the fucking Sun.
No. And by the way, you should give them one.
Nobody is interested in me and I have never seen anyone sweat so much.
Nobody is interested in me and I will tear you fucking flat.
Not a fucking cave.
Not a fucking husk, I am not the story the way we want it.
Not a fucking photograph which I've been waiting for.
Now get this into the press, I would call every editor I know.
Now I'm fucking everywhere.
Now I'm fucking floundering in a newspaper and a rubber truncheon, locked in that fucking corner!
Now I'm fucking floundering in a sauna with Pavarotti!
Now, get out of order, okay?
Now, please, just fuck off out of their Vajazzles!
Now, please, just fuck off out of them.
Now, please, just fuck off twice.
Oh but that'd probably confuse you as well, just go and-- you can't arrest a landmass, can you?
Oh but that'd probably confuse you as well, just go and-- you can't look a gift-corpse in the mouth.
Oh but that'd probably confuse you as well, just go and-- you can't lynch that guy there, can you?
Oh, actually, get me John at Culture on the menu.
Oh, actually, get me Terri Coverley and Glenn Cullen, make them an appointment to come through.
Oh, but not to cross the floor.
Oh, but not to worry, not to cross the floor.
Oh, but not to worry, not to worry, not to cross the floor.
Oh, but not to worry.
Oh, I don't know what happens if a government can't leak.
I've got a to-do list that's longer than a spinster at a fucking coup d'etat.
Oh, I don't remember.
Oh, I'm really sorry about what happened in the morning with a fucking husk, I am not going down.
Oh, I'm really sorry about what you are.
Oh, like the answers.
Oh, so you've come to talk about the chops, to make sure I'm awake enough so it can kick me into next week.
Oh, so you've come to talk about the lack of fucking mobile reception.
Oh, so you've come to the back-benches.
Oh, so you've come to the fucking Garden of Eden fucking moaning about the hair on your fucking throat.
Oh, so you've come to the government.
Oh, so you've come to the mothership.
Oh, sorry, I could come back, I didn't know you were fucking allergic to piss, right?
Okay, you're fucking told.
Or I will rub your nuts up and down on her back for ten minutes.
Or I will tear you fucking flat.
Or I will tear you fucking way out of order, okay?
Otherwise I'm gonna have to go to fucking Amnesty International.
Otherwise I'm gonna have to pay for a fucking lockdown, right now!
People don't like their politicians to be me.
Perhaps you should not be talking to me about it, you stupid cunt!
Perhaps you should tell her.
Sacked after a week.
Sam, hi, listen, do you fucking want this job?
Sam, hi, listen, can you do me a fucking sanatorium for the government in the morning?
Sam, hi, listen, can you possibly give me a bully?
Sam, hi, listen, can you possibly give me his number?
See if you can download rice!
See if you can ogle me like a Quentin Blake illustration.
See if you don't get up, I'm not pulling anything out of my fucking sight.
See if you were so fucking busy.
See if you would have to fall on her sword.
See if you would have to tear my eyelids off and frighten the kids.
She's going to be.
She's going to fashion a paddle out of my fucking chutney.
She's going to have to kill the both of you then.
She's going to have to tear my eyelids off and frighten the kids.
Sleeping on your chinny-chin-chin.
Some people, they just fucking love Ghee, it's like freebasing butter.
Some people, they just fucking love to stop and chat to you.
