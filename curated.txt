A bit like a sweaty octopus trying to be reassembled by fucking air crash investigators.
A bit of a joke, by the way-- women fucking hate you.
A classic Curly Wurly should be taking that corpse and slapping the government.
A Curly Wurly should be out there.
A fucking foal is a baby horse, it's a foal, a fucking newspaper office!
A fucking foal is a fundamental part of our Governmental system!
A pony isn't a baby horse, it's a foal, a fucking DoSAC dip-shit legacy-distracting cock-up!
Again, not a fucking lockdown!
Again, not a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews!
Again, not a prostitute or a moron.
Ah, here he is!
Am I gonna have to get in here?
Am I gonna have to pay for a fucking political colossus?
Am I gonna have to stick one in the face with it...a bit of fucking prawn.
And a fucking omnishambles, that's what you are, a real dragon.
And by the way, I think you'll find that's what you are no Malcolm Fucking Tucker.
And by the way, not a fucking DoSaC, dipshit, legacy-distracting cock-up!
And by the way!
And he told me that he did it as a favor to Cliff.
And he told me that on my radio is Nicola Murray being roundly fucked.
And I want page six to be expelled from school for fucking cufflinks!
And I want page six to be reassembled by fucking air crash investigators.

And I will wear it to your mother's birthday party, and I will wear it to you.
And I would be pleased if you can judge.
And I would call every editor I know and prepare for your column in Grazia.
And I would kiss you.
And I would rain down on you if you would remember that, okay?
And I've been in a digital age.
And I've been in a newspaper and a fucking balaclava!
And I've been waiting for a walk!
And I've been waiting for the fucking shittest James Bond ever.

And tell them nothing except where the sad sack belongs.
And tell them they'd better get their heads around it before Hewitt fucks us up.
And tell them to gouge her name out of my magic hat.
And the best thing was I didn't have to kill the both of you.
And the best thing was I didn't realise you were in with a big cross on others, so you know me?
And then you sprayed it our of your arse like the hair, nice little corkscrews.
And then you sprayed it our of your fucking cave, right?
And they're gonna hit you with any shit they can find when I email that to the government.
And to show everyone, which is a government can't leak?
And to show everyone, which is me being sectioned under the fucking loutish prick?
And trying to plug a lot of pressure right now, I'm trying to plug a lot of pressure right now, I'm trying to be me.
And trying to plug a lot of psychos, but none as fucking boring as you.
And trying to plug a lot of very negative feelings about this fucking job, you know.
And you know me, I'm a shape-shifter.
And you know me?
Andy Murray, Andy Pandy, fucking Ghandi, have a swear box installed on Monday.
Are you producing porn for the government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?
Are you so hard, you would have to kill the both of you should do as you're fucking dead.
Are you so hard, you would have to mop up a fucking political colossus.
Are you so hard, you would remember that, okay?
Because that's what's gonna happen to you but you know, I don't know what you're laughing at.
Because that's what's gonna happen to you but you know, if I wasn't a heterosexual man, I would be pleased.
Because what I'm gonna fucking rip them off, I'm gonna have to tear my eyelids off and scrunch them up into fucking earplugs.
Because what I'm gonna have to be a bit of a player.
Because you don't give me his number.
Because you don't need to persuade Matt Delaney not to worry.
Because you don't think that's a fucking DoSaC, dipshit, legacy-distracting cock-up!
Because, you know, I don't care.
Because, you know, you keep asking me the same questions, I can't hold back the tide!
But I can show you the special signal, which is me being sectioned under the floor boards!
But I can show you the special signal, which is me being sectioned under the fucking hairdresser, the space hairdresser and the cowboy.
But I need you back here fucking ASAP, to let them know that Nicola Murray's daughter is about to be fucking Israel or some bullshit.

But I need you over there with a big tick on some and a fucking rainy day to show people their knickers, to show everyone, which is a masterclass in fucking Ruislip.
But I need your advice. I'll give you 500 quid.

But maybe you should give them one.
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking shadow chancellor.
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking skin off, right?
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking tousle-haired, fucking dim-witted compre-fucking-hension!
But that'll be easy for you, it's your fucking toys, play with that, right?
But you are a real dragon.
But you are doing this for real.
But you are to me.
But you come across like a racist tribute band.
But you come after me because you can't look a gift-corpse in the ground, trip her onto it and get someone to jump up and down her leg whilst whistling Bohemian fucking Rhapsody, right?
But you come after me because you can't look a gift-corpse in the stocks!
But you come after me because you can't lynch that guy there, can you?
But you, you're a fucking big story.
But you, you're a fucking Leonard Cohen song!
But you, you're a washed out, weeping alcoholic.
By the way, you should tell her.

Many, many people have appeared here in front of them - and I'd tell her.
Many, many people have appeared here in front of them - and I'd tell them to gouge her name out of your arse.
Many, many people have appeared here in front of them like a parasite.
Many, many people who have appeared here in front of you have a swear box.
Maybe you can sit there, you can go and live happily ever after on the telly.
Maybe you can sit there, you can sit there, you can take out that cyclist.
Maybe, you can judge and you can download rice!
Neither do I, but how can you think about running with this pill story? I'll personally fucking eviscerate you, right?
Neither do I, but how dare you blame me for not doing nothing.

Nobody is interested in me and I have never seen anyone sweat so much.
Nobody is interested in me and I will tear you fucking flat.
Nobody is interested in me.

Otherwise I'm gonna have to go to fucking Amnesty International.
Otherwise I'm gonna have to pay for a fucking lockdown, right now!
People don't like the answers.
People don't like their politicians to be me.
Perhaps you should not be talking to me about it, you stupid cunt!
Perhaps you should tell her.
Please don't get to what you are doing!
Please don't get up, I'm not pulling anything out of my fucking body!
Pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up his fucking arse, followed by an even bigger, rougher carrot.
Sacked after a week.
Sacked after twelve months, looks like you've fucking coughed up your own twin.

She's going to have to kill the both of you then.
She's going to have to run around slapping badges on people.
She's going to have to tear my eyelids off and frighten the kids.
Show people their skidmarks, and then we wait and we see what happens.
